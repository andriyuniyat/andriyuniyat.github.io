    <h1>Why SSO alone does not equal security</h1>
    <p>Single Sign-On is necessary—but without ownership and lifecycle controls, it creates a false sense of safety.</p>
  </div>

  <article class="prose">
    <p>
      Single Sign-On (SSO) is often treated as the finish line for SaaS security.
      Once users authenticate through a central identity provider, teams assume risk has been meaningfully reduced.
      In reality, SSO is only the entry point.
    </p>

    <p>
      At scale, most security incidents and audit findings don’t happen because authentication failed.
      They happen because access was never removed, roles drifted over time, or no one owned the application lifecycle.
    </p>

    <h2>What SSO actually solves</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Centralized authentication</li>
      <li>Password and MFA consistency</li>
      <li>Faster onboarding for new users</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are important foundations—but they don’t address what happens <em>after</em> a user is authenticated.
    </p>

    <h2>Where risk really accumulates</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Users retain access long after roles change</li>
      <li>Offboarding is delayed or incomplete</li>
      <li>Admins grant one-off exceptions without visibility</li>
      <li>No one reviews access because “SSO is enabled”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      SSO can actually amplify risk if it’s layered on top of unclear ownership and manual access processes.
      Central login makes it easier to get in—but doesn’t ensure the <em>right</em> access exists.
    </p>

    <h2>What reduces risk in practice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear ownership for each application</li>
      <li>Group-based access models tied to roles, not individuals</li>
      <li>Defined joiner–mover–leaver workflows</li>
      <li>Regular access reviews with accountable owners</li>
      <li>Documentation that explains how access is granted and removed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These controls aren’t glamorous, but they’re what auditors look for—and what actually prevent incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>SSO as part of a system, not a checkbox</h2>
    <p>
      The most effective environments treat SSO as one component of a broader identity system.
      Authentication, authorization, lifecycle management, and governance all reinforce each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      When SSO is implemented without that system-level thinking, it creates confidence without control.
      When it’s implemented with ownership and lifecycle discipline, it becomes a powerful enabler.
    </p>

    <p class="footnote">
      Security isn’t achieved by turning on a feature—it’s achieved by designing access as a system that evolves with the business.
