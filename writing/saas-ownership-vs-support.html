      <h1>SaaS ownership vs SaaS support</h1>
      <p>At scale, the difference is governance, lifecycle thinking, and operational guardrails.</p>

      <p>
        “SaaS support” keeps tools functioning. “SaaS ownership” makes tools reliable, secure, and scalable.
        They overlap—but they aren’t the same job.
      </p>

      <h2>Support is reactive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixing access issues, troubleshooting incidents, answering “how-to” questions</li>
        <li>Working tickets and resolving immediate blockers</li>
        <li>Keeping users productive day-to-day</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ownership is systemic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lifecycle design:</strong> onboarding → changes → offboarding → reviews</li>
        <li><strong>Governance:</strong> least privilege, access models, audit readiness</li>
        <li><strong>Standards:</strong> consistent configurations, documented runbooks, predictable operations</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> release notes, stakeholder alignment, and minimizing change friction</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A simple test</h2>
      <p>
        If the platform owner is out for a week, does everything keep running without heroics?
        Ownership builds systems that don’t depend on tribal knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Organizations don’t just need “tools.” They need platforms that are safe, auditable, and usable—especially in regulated environments.
        That’s why platform ownership is increasingly valued (and compensated) differently than general support work.
