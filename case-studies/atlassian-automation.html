      <h1>Owning Atlassian platforms to improve intake, governance, and scale</h1>
      <p>Operational platform ownership using Jira/Confluence administration, workflow design, permissions, and automation.</p>

    <article class="prose">
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        As Jira and Confluence adoption expanded across teams, inconsistent intake, permissions, and workflows led to delays,
        rework, and avoidable escalations. I owned the administration and operational design of the Atlassian platform to make
        request flow predictable, auditable, and scalable.
      </p>

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Owned Jira/Confluence administration: templates, permission schemes, workflow design, and operational standards</li>
        <li>Partnered with stakeholders to define routing rules, request quality requirements, and ownership boundaries</li>
        <li>Created documentation and enablement guidance to drive adoption and reduce repetitive questions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardized intake:</strong> implemented request forms/templates and required fields to improve request quality</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced manual triage:</strong> built automation rules for routing, status transitions, and notifications</li>
        <li><strong>Permission hygiene:</strong> aligned access with least privilege while maintaining usability for teams</li>
        <li><strong>Operational guardrails:</strong> documented “what happens next” flows and created runbooks for admins/support</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption support:</strong> delivered concise guidance so business users understood the process and expectations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Constraints &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Standardized workflows without over-customizing the platform (kept it maintainable and upgrade-friendly)</li>
        <li>Balanced automation with transparency so teams could trust and understand what the system was doing</li>
        <li>Maintained least-privilege permissions without creating unnecessary friction for high-velocity teams</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved intake-to-assignment speed by reducing manual handoffs and routing ambiguity</li>
        <li>Reduced back-and-forth by increasing request quality and consistency through standard fields/templates</li>
        <li>Increased stakeholder confidence by making ownership and request lifecycle predictable</li>
        <li>Lowered repeat questions and operational noise through reusable templates and clear documentation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I’d do next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce lightweight metrics (cycle time, reopen rate) to guide continuous improvement</li>
        <li>Formalize a change-log/release note process to keep stakeholders aligned and reduce surprise changes</li>
      </ul>
