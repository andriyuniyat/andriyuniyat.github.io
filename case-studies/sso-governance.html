      <p>Standardizing identity patterns to reduce access risk, improve audit readiness, and scale SaaS operations in a regulated environment.</p>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        In a regulated enterprise environment, inconsistent SaaS access models create audit risk, operational friction, and security gaps.
        I was responsible for designing and governing a standardized SSO and access management approach across <strong>10+ business-critical SaaS platforms</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Owned identity integration standards and access patterns across SaaS applications</li>
        <li>Partnered with Security, HR, Legal, and IT stakeholders to align governance requirements</li>
        <li>Defined implementation approach, operational handoff, and documentation/runbooks</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardized SSO patterns:</strong> implemented SSO using Azure AD / Entra ID with SAML or OIDC based on vendor capability</li>
        <li><strong>Provisioning strategy:</strong> leveraged SCIM where supported; otherwise established controlled provisioning/deprovisioning alternatives</li>
        <li><strong>Group-based access model:</strong> aligned roles/groups to least-privilege access with clear ownership and change workflow</li>
        <li><strong>Operational readiness:</strong> created runbooks for certificate/metadata lifecycle, troubleshooting, and escalation paths</li>
        <li><strong>Governance cadence:</strong> implemented access review checkpoints and documentation standards to support audits</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Constraints &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Not all vendors supported SCIM or granular roles, requiring alternative controls and process guardrails</li>
        <li>Security requirements had to be balanced against user experience to ensure adoption and minimize exceptions</li>
        <li>Access models needed to remain auditable and understandable without introducing unnecessary operational overhead</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced access risk by eliminating “one-off” access paths and standardizing group-based access patterns</li>
        <li>Improved audit readiness through clearer ownership, access review practices, and consistent documentation</li>
        <li>Decreased onboarding/offboarding friction by streamlining identity workflows and reducing manual touchpoints</li>
        <li>Lowered access-related escalations by standardizing troubleshooting steps and operational runbooks</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I’d do next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Automate access review reporting where feasible to improve visibility and reduce effort</li>
        <li>Continue hardening conditional access posture and exception handling</li>
        <li>Build a centralized “access model catalog” for all SaaS applications to simplify governance and onboarding</li>
      </ul>
