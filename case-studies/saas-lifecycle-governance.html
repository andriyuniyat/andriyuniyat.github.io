    <h1>Governing enterprise SaaS platforms across the full lifecycle</h1>
    <p>From onboarding and access control to renewals, audits, and long-term ownership.</p>

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      As organizations scale, SaaS platforms often accumulate without clear ownership, governance standards,
      or lifecycle discipline. This creates security risk, audit gaps, operational friction, and renewal surprises.
      I was responsible for governing multiple enterprise SaaS platforms across their full lifecycle in a regulated environment.
    </p>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Owned SaaS platform governance from onboarding through renewal and decommissioning</li>
      <li>Defined access, identity integration, and ownership standards for business applications</li>
      <li>Acted as a technical partner to Security, Legal, HR, Finance, and IT leadership</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ownership clarity:</strong> established clear technical and business owners for each SaaS platform</li>
      <li><strong>Access governance:</strong> aligned identity integration, provisioning, and access review requirements</li>
      <li><strong>Vendor alignment:</strong> partnered with Security and Legal on risk assessments, contract language, and renewals</li>
      <li><strong>Operational continuity:</strong> documented platform dependencies, renewal dates, and runbooks</li>
      <li><strong>Lifecycle thinking:</strong> treated SaaS as long-lived systems, not one-time implementations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Constraints &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Different vendors provided inconsistent security and identity capabilities</li>
      <li>Governance needed to scale without becoming a blocker to business adoption</li>
      <li>Documentation had to be thorough yet usable by multiple teams</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced long-term risk by clarifying ownership and governance expectations across platforms</li>
      <li>Improved audit readiness by maintaining consistent access and documentation sta
