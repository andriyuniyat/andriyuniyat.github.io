    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Manual onboarding and offboarding processes increase the risk of orphaned accounts,
      excessive access, and audit findings. I was responsible for designing and improving
      identity lifecycle workflows to make access changes predictable, auditable, and scalable.
    </p>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Owned identity lifecycle design across SaaS applications</li>
      <li>Integrated HR-driven events with identity and access workflows</li>
      <li>Partnered with Security and IT to reduce manual access handling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Joiner:</strong> standardized onboarding using group-based access and identity-driven provisioning</li>
      <li><strong>Mover:</strong> aligned role changes with access updates to prevent privilege creep</li>
      <li><strong>Leaver:</strong> ensured timely deprovisioning and access removal across connected systems</li>
      <li><strong>Fallback controls:</strong> documented manual processes where automation was not technically possible</li>
      <li><strong>Operational visibility:</strong> created documentation and checkpoints for access changes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Constraints &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not all SaaS platforms supported full automation or SCIM provisioning</li>
      <li>Identity workflows needed to accommodate edge cases without becoming brittle</li>
      <li>Security controls had to align with HR and business timelines</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced orphaned accounts and delayed access removal through standardized workflows</li>
      <li>Lowered operational overhead by minimizing manual access changes</li>
      <li>Improved audit confidence by making access lifecycle steps consistent and documentable</li>
      <li>Created a repeatable identity pattern reusable across future SaaS integrations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I’d do next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expand automation coverage as vendors mature their identity capabilities</li>
      <li>Introduce periodic lifecycle audits to catch edge cases and drift</li>
    </ul>
