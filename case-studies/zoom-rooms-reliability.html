      <p>Reducing drift and recurring issues through configuration standards, lifecycle practices, and support-ready documentation.</p>

    <article class="prose">
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Managing a growing Zoom Rooms footprint without standards quickly leads to configuration drift, unclear ownership,
        and recurring reliability issues. I was responsible for standardizing Zoom Rooms configuration, lifecycle practices,
        and operational documentation across multiple conference spaces to make the environment reliable and supportable.
      </p>

      <h2>My role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Owned Zoom platform and Zoom Rooms administration and operational practices</li>
        <li>Defined room standards and lifecycle hygiene to reduce drift and recurring failures</li>
        <li>Created documentation and troubleshooting playbooks for IT/support teams</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardized room profiles:</strong> aligned settings to ensure consistent behavior across rooms</li>
        <li><strong>Lifecycle hygiene:</strong> defined firmware/updates approach and routine maintenance checkpoints</li>
        <li><strong>Operational documentation:</strong> built quick troubleshooting guides and escalation playbooks</li>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder alignment:</strong> communicated changes in a simple way to minimize end-user disruption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Constraints &amp; tradeoffs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Different room hardware required consistent behavior without identical configurations</li>
        <li>Updates needed to minimize disruption to high-visibility meetings and executive usage</li>
        <li>Documentation had to be usable by both IT and support teams (clear, fast, and actionable)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved room reliability by reducing configuration drift and enforcing consistent standards</li>
        <li>Reduced recurring room issues by aligning profiles and lifecycle practices across the environment</li>
        <li>Faster troubleshooting using standardized runbooks and clear escalation paths</li>
        <li>More predictable end-user experience through consistent room behavior and support readiness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I’d do next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand reporting and establish a regular health review cadence for rooms and devices</li>
        <li>Continue hardening device policies to reduce edge-case failures and improve lifecycle predictability</li>
      </ul>
